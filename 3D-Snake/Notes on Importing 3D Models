1. Make the 3D models (done)

2. Export the model 
  -The most common formats for exporting 3D models to game engines are FBX and OBJ. 
  -The FBX format supports animations, whereas OBJ is used for static models.
  -FBX format would be used for the snake in this case, while OBJ might be used for the environment/map.

3. Importing the Model to a game engine. 
    -Using Unreal Engine as an example: Go to the Content Browser and click on the Import button.
    -Choose the FBX or OBJ File: Locate the exported file and click Open.
    -Settings: When importing, ensure that the correct import settings are applied (such as skeletal mesh for animated models or static mesh for non-animated).

4. Make sure the models are working

5. Add Movement to the models that need to move.

6. Use unity as backup if github doesn't work.
